# Code easy

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/98c22045d3924f2fbf045b5da3ef7efa)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/code-easy-platform/code-easy-web?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=code-easy-platform/code-easy-web&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

Code easy platform is a web platform for developing APIs in nodejs that helps you develop your entire backend much faster than the traditional way.

## How will it work

> **`Attention`**: This application is not yet 100% functional, that is, many of the expected features are not working yet or have not even been developed

* Enter the platform link.
* Choose to create a new project.
* Enter the basic information of the project (name, description, type of project ...).
* Click on create project.

*At this point the platform creates a new project and goes to the main screen of the application. The main screen is where all the coding of the application in question can be done*

* Click on the "run" button to have the platform connect to a websocket previously installed on your machine.
* The application that exposes the websocket will execute all the necessary part for the API in nodejs to be executed in localhost:3333.
